# ROT-13.5
Implement a similar encryption scheme to ROT 13 called ROT 13.5. In this encryption scheme whenever you encrypt a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) as plain text, the next encrypted letter moves to the next letter 14 times in the latin alphabet. In all other cases a plain text letter will be moved to the next letter 13 times. This means that the word “hello” becomes “urzyb” under rot 13.5
